This is a workbook where I used the Happiness and World Bank Income inequality Gini measure combined by J.Ward [Dataset available [here](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=40916&status=active)] during my learning at Foundations of Data Science: K-Means Clustering in Python 

I have created some very basic visualisations and employed the k-means clustering algorithm on this dataset. I have considered the variables: Happiness Score, GDP, median income and country.

Note: This is a very rough "workbook" and annotations are more catering towards my own understanding and learning over consiceness
